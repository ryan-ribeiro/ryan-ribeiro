### 📌 Introduction
 
Hello there! 👋 I'm Ryan Ribeiro, a new member of the GitHub community. As a Computer Engineering student from Goiânia, Goiás State of Brazil, I'm constantly honing my skills and exploring new technologies. I try to test a wide range of sensors, coding and communications protocols to solve problems I come with. While I primarily program in C, I'm also diving into the world of Java object-oriented programming.

### 👨‍💻 Skills & Interests
